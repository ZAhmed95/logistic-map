# Logistic Map

A logistic map is a function of the general form:
`X(n+1) = A * X(n) * (1 - X(n))`

This is a recurrence relation, as each successive value of the function X depends on the previous value.

The inputs to the logistic map are the initial value X(0), and the constant coefficient A.

For more information, download and view the PowerPoint presentation included in this repo, logistic_map.pptx

Or, check out the [Wikipedia article on logistic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map)

To test the program yourself, download the included JAR file (logistic_map.jar) and run it. A GUI will appear, allowing you to choose the value of A and two initial values of X(0), resulting in two different maps.
